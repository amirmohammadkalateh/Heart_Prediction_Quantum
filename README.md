# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree

This project implements a machine learning model to predict heart disease using a Decision Tree classifier. The model is trained on a quantum-enhanced dataset that includes various health metrics and patient characteristics.

## Features

- Decision Tree-based classification
- Visualization of the decision tree structure
- Feature importance analysis
- Detailed performance metrics
- Quantum-enhanced dataset

## Dataset Features

- Age
- Gender
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Heart Rate
- Quantum Pattern Feature
- Heart Disease (Target Variable)

## Performance Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Confusion Matrix

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- graphviz

## Usage

Run the model using the Run button on Replit or execute:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:
1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Train the decision tree model
3. Generate predictions
4. Display performance metrics
5. Save the decision tree visualization

## Files

- `Heart Prediction Quantum Dataset.csv`: Dataset file
- `decision_tree.png`: Visualization of the trained decision tree

## Output

The program outputs:
- Model accuracy
- Detailed classification metrics
- Feature importance ranking
- Decision tree visualization
